# 10/50/90 Rule

## Introduction

In the dynamic world of management and leadership, it's crucial for managers and leaders to have the space to perform their tasks efficiently. However, synchronizing these efforts with the entire team is equally important to ensure a cohesive and productive workflow. Often, we find ourselves at a crossroads, unsure of how to proceed without explicit confirmation from our leaders, leading to wasted effort and potential missteps.

To address this challenge, I’d like to introduce you to the 10/50/90 Rule. This approach offers a structured method to keep our leaders informed and engaged throughout the project lifecycle, ensuring alignment and reducing the risk of unnecessary rework. By applying the 10/50/90 Rule, we can enhance our collaboration, maintain clear communication, and ultimately drive our projects to successful completion with greater efficiency and confidence.

Let's delve into how the 10/50/90 Rule can transform our teamwork and project management practices.

## The 10/50/90 Rule Explained

### 10% - Initial Planning

At the 10% mark of our process, a minimal but clear plan should be in place. This includes:

- **Project Scope:** Outline of features and objectives from [Backlog]().
- **Roles & Responsibilities:** Who does what?
- **Initial Timelines:** Tentative milestones based on [Sprint planning.]()

#### Example:

### Project Scope

- Implement the authentication module.
- Design user profile management.

### Roles & Responsibilities

- Anh Le: Scrum Master
- Thuat Nguyen: Lead Developer, Authentication.
- Cuong Nguyen/Duy Cao: UI/UX Designer

### Initial Timelines

- Authentication Module: Complete by May 5th.
- Profile Management: Design phase until April 20th.

### 50% - Midpoint Check-In

When we're halfway through, a more detailed status report is provided with revised timelines and progress:

- **Updated Milestones:** Adjustments to timelines.
- **Progress Report:** What’s been done, what's pending.
- **Risk Assessment:** Potential issues or blockers.

#### Example:

### Updated Milestones

- Authentication Module: On track for May 5th completion.
- Profile Management: Design delayed, new deadline April 25th.

### Progress Report

- Authentication: Backend complete, frontend integration underway.
- Profile Management: Wireframes approved, high-fidelity designs in progress.

### Risk Assessment

- Profile Management: Vendor delay on design tools could push back the timeline.

### 90% - Final Stretch

As we approach completion, our focus is on final deliverables and preparing for handoff:

- **Final Deliverables:** Checklist of what needs to be completed.
- **[User Acceptance Testing (UAT)]():** Plan for testing and feedback.
- **Launch Prep:** Steps remaining for launch.

#### Example:

### Final Deliverables

- [ ] Complete integration of authentication module.
- [ ] Finalize all high-fidelity designs for profile management.
- [ ] Conduct code review and quality assurance for each module.

### User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

- Prepare test cases for authentication flow.
- Schedule a UAT session with stakeholders on May 10th.

### Launch Prep

- Ensure documentation is updated.
- Plan go-live date: May 15th.
- Coordinate marketing materials.

## Sync Up and Reporting

- **Daily Stand-ups (SCRUM Team):** Brief meetings to discuss current progress.
- **Bi-weekly demos (Sprint demonstration):** Show-and-tell sessions for completed work.
- **Monthly Reports:** Detailed progress, risks, and next steps.

Ensuring transparency and regular communication will help us maintain momentum and ensure our product owner is adequately informed without requiring their constant involvement. This structure facilitates autonomy within the team while keeping the larger goals in sight.
