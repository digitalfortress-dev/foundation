# User Story Writing Guidelines

## What is a User Story?

A User Story describes a feature from the user's perspective:

> **As a** [user type], **I want** [goal] **so that** [benefit].

## 🧩 Common User Story Structure

### 1. Title
**Format:**  
`[Epic / Service / ...] + a short description of the User Story`

**Example:**  
`[Authentication] Reset Password via Email`

---

### 2. User Story
**Format:**  
> As a [persona], I want [goal], so that [benefit].

**Example:**  
> As a registered user,  
> I want to be able to reset my password through a secure email link,  
> So that I can regain access to my account without contacting customer support.

---

### 3. Context
- **If it’s a new feature:** Explain why it is needed.  
- **If it’s an update:** Describe both the current state (**AS-IS**) and the desired state (**TO-BE**).

**Example:**  
>**AS-IS:**  
>Users who forget their passwords must contact customer support to manually reset them, which increases handling time and reduces user satisfaction.  

>**TO-BE:**  
>Users can securely request a password reset link via email directly from the login page and reset their passwords without needing support assistance.

---

### 4. Pre-conditions (Optional)
Describe any conditions that must be met before implementation.  

**Example:**  
>The user must have a registered and verified email address.

---

### 5. UI Link (Optional)
Attach any relevant design or UI references.  

**Example:**  
>[Figma Design – Password Reset Flow](https://www.figma.com/file/example/password-reset-flow)

---

### 6. Acceptance Criteria
- For new features, outline possible scenarios using the **Given – When – Then** format.  
- If the requirements are already clear, summarize the completion conditions briefly.

**Examples:**

**Scenario 1 – User Requests Password Reset**  

>Given a registered user is on the login page
>When the user clicks “Forgot Password” and enters their registered email address
>Then the system sends a password reset email and displays:
>"If this email is registered, a reset link has been sent."



**Scenario 2 – User Resets Password Successfully**  

>Given the user has received a password reset email
>When they click the link within 15 minutes and enter a valid new password
>Then the system updates the password and allows the user to log in with the new one.


**Scenario 3 – Password Reset Link Expired**  

>Given the reset link was sent more than 15 minutes ago
>When the user clicks on it
>Then the system displays: "This link has expired. Please request a new password reset."


---

### 7. Detail Task Description (Specs)
Describe the detailed workflow and technical specifications for implementation.

**Example:**

> - The user goes to the login page and clicks “Forgot Password.”
> - The user enters their email; invalid formats trigger inline errors.  
> - Valid inputs submit the reset request.
> - The system verifies the email, generates a 15-minute token if valid, and sends a reset email.  
> - A generic success message is shown to avoid email disclosure.
> - The user receives a reset link (`/reset-password?token=z`).  
> - Clicking it validates the token — valid tokens show the reset form; invalid ones show an error with a “Request Again” option.
> - The user sets a new password, which must be strong and different from the previous one.  
> - The system updates credentials, invalidates the token, and confirms success with a login prompt.
> - The user gets a confirmation email; all active sessions are logged out, and system logs are updated for security.

## 📒 DOR (Definition of Ready)
Follow these criteria to ensure each story is ready to **Start the Sprint**:
- [x] User Story is clearly defined with a complete workflow and AC  
- [x] Dependencies are identified (optional).  
- [x] UI/UX prototype is linked and approved (optional).  
- [x] Story points are estimated, and the story is sprint-ready.  
- [x] Product Owner has reviewed and approved the story (nice to have).  

## 📋 Simple Checklist

Before writing a user story:
- [ ] Is the "As a..." role a real end user?
- [ ] Does this deliver value to that user?
- [ ] Can we test this when it's done?
- [ ] Is it small enough for one sprint?


## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ CRITICAL: Never Use Development Roles

**NEVER write user stories using development roles:**
- ❌ "As a Product Owner, I want..."
- ❌ "As a Developer, I want..."
- ❌ "As a Scrum Master, I want..."
- ❌ "As a Business Analyst, I want..."

### Why Development Roles Are Wrong

**Development roles should NEVER be used in user stories because:**

1. **They don't represent end users** - These roles don't use the final product
2. **They don't deliver customer value** - Internal efficiency doesn't directly benefit customers
3. **They create confusion** - Stories should focus on external value, not internal processes
4. **They violate the user story purpose** - Stories should capture customer needs, not team needs

### ✅ Use These Instead of Development Roles

**Instead of development roles, use:**
- **Actual end users**: customers, clients, visitors, subscribers
- **Specific personas**: premium users, new users, admin users, mobile users
- **Business stakeholders**: store owners, managers, employees (if they're actual users of the system)

**Examples of Correct User Roles:**
- ✅ "As a customer, I want..."
- ✅ "As a premium subscriber, I want..."
- ✅ "As a store manager, I want..."
- ✅ "As a mobile user, I want..."
- ✅ "As a first-time visitor, I want..."

## User Story vs Spike vs Enabler

### User Stories
**For:** Features that users can see and use
**Format:** As a [user], I want [goal] so that [benefit]
**Example:**
```
As a customer
I want to track my order status
So that I know when to expect delivery
```

### Spikes
**For:** Research or investigation work
**Format:** 
```
Spike: [Research topic]
Time-box: [1-3 days]
Goal: [What we need to learn]
```
**Example:**
```
Spike: Payment Gateway Options
Time-box: 2 days
Goal: Compare Stripe vs PayPal integration costs and features
```

### Enablers  
**For:** Technical work that supports future features
**Format:**
```
Enabler: [Technical capability]
Enables: [Future user stories]
```
**Example:**
```
Enabler: Set up user authentication system
Enables: Login, profile management, and personalization features
```

## How to Separate Them

Ask yourself:
1. **Does a user directly benefit from this?** → User Story
2. **Do we need to research something first?** → Spike  
3. **Does this enable future user features?** → Enabler

**Remember: Focus on real users and the value they get from your product.**
