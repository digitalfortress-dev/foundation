# User Story Writing Guidelines

## What is a User Story?

A User Story describes a feature from the user's perspective:

> **As a** [user type], **I want** [goal] **so that** [benefit].

## Basic Format with Definition of Done

```
Title: [Brief descriptive title]

As a [persona/role]
I want [functionality/capability]
So that [business value/benefit]

Acceptance Criteria:
- Given [context/precondition]
  When [action/event]
  Then [expected outcome]

Definition of Done:
- [ ] Code complete and reviewed
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] UI/UX approved
- [ ] Documentation updated
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ CRITICAL: Never Use Internal Roles

**NEVER write user stories using internal team roles:**
- ❌ "As a Product Owner, I want..."
- ❌ "As a Developer, I want..."
- ❌ "As a Scrum Master, I want..."
- ❌ "As a Business Analyst, I want..."

### Why Internal Roles Are Wrong

**Internal roles should NEVER be used in user stories because:**

1. **They don't represent end users** - These roles don't use the final product
2. **They don't deliver customer value** - Internal efficiency doesn't directly benefit customers
3. **They create confusion** - Stories should focus on external value, not internal processes
4. **They violate the user story purpose** - Stories should capture customer needs, not team needs

### ✅ Use These Instead of Internal Roles

**Instead of internal roles, use:**
- **Actual end users**: customers, clients, visitors, subscribers
- **Specific personas**: premium users, new users, admin users, mobile users
- **Business stakeholders**: store owners, managers, employees (if they're actual users of the system)

**Examples of Correct User Roles:**
- ✅ "As a customer, I want..."
- ✅ "As a premium subscriber, I want..."
- ✅ "As a store manager, I want..."
- ✅ "As a mobile user, I want..."
- ✅ "As a first-time visitor, I want..."

## User Story vs Spike vs Enabler

### User Stories
**For:** Features that users can see and use
**Format:** As a [user], I want [goal] so that [benefit]
**Example:**
```
As a customer
I want to track my order status
So that I know when to expect delivery
```

### Spikes
**For:** Research or investigation work
**Format:** 
```
Spike: [Research topic]
Time-box: [1-3 days]
Goal: [What we need to learn]
```
**Example:**
```
Spike: Payment Gateway Options
Time-box: 2 days
Goal: Compare Stripe vs PayPal integration costs and features
```

### Enablers  
**For:** Technical work that supports future features
**Format:**
```
Enabler: [Technical capability]
Enables: [Future user stories]
```
**Example:**
```
Enabler: Set up user authentication system
Enables: Login, profile management, and personalization features
```

## How to Separate Them

Ask yourself:
1. **Does a user directly benefit from this?** → User Story
2. **Do we need to research something first?** → Spike  
3. **Does this enable future user features?** → Enabler

## Simple Checklist

Before writing a user story:
- [ ] Is the "As a..." role a real end user?
- [ ] Does this deliver value to that user?
- [ ] Can we test this when it's done?
- [ ] Is it small enough for one sprint?

**Remember: Focus on real users and the value they get from your product.**
