In this part, let's deep dive into some tools used in Agile/Scrum project managment 

>Remember that these tools are not part of the Scrum framework, they are supporting tools to help the Scrum team quickly grasp the progress of the sprint as well as the overall status of the project. 

Each tool is used at different stages of the sprint and serves specific purposes. When used effectively, these tools contribute to maintaining a healthy and well-managed sprint. The primary users can vary, from the Scrum Master to developers and other team members.

### 1. Velocity
 
Provides a visual overview of how much work is completed in each sprint and how fast the team is progressing. 

It supports better estimation and monitoring. While often used by the Scrum Master to track team performance, it is also accessible to developers or anyone in the Scrum Team. The chart can be monitored at any point during the sprint.

### 2. Burndown chart

Shows the amount of work remaining in the sprint day by day, helping the team assess whether the sprint goal can be achieved within the timebox. 

This chart is usually monitored by the Scrum Master but is also available to all team members through Agile management tools such as Jira or Redmine.

### 3. Burnup chart

In contrast to the burndown chart, the burn-up chart shows progress toward the total scope of work, clearly indicating how much has already been completed versus how much remains. 

It is useful for visualizing both completed work and changes in scope over time.

### 4. Time-spent Tracking on Redmine / Jira
 	
Recording the time spent on tasks is often required for external stakeholders, especially for invoicing and billing purposes. 

Accurate time logging ensures transparency, supports a fair billing process, and provides insight into workload distribution among team members.

>This tasks completion is greatly appreciated to ensure accountability, professionalism, and maintain an accurate record of progress, from all team members. So please keep in mind about logging your time on Redmine!
