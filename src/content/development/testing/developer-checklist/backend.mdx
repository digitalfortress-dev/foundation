# Back-End Development Checklist

## Functional Testing

- [ ] Verify all endpoints are functioning as expected.
- [ ] Ensure all input validations are working correctly (e.g., required fields, data types).
- [ ] Test all business logic to ensure it performs as intended.
- [ ] Confirm that database operations (CRUD) are working correctly.

## Security

- [ ] Validate that all input data is properly sanitized and validated.
- [ ] Ensure proper authentication and authorization mechanisms are in place.
- [ ] Confirm that sensitive data (e.g., passwords, tokens) is encrypted and securely stored.
- [ ] Check for common security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, etc.
- [ ] Verify that secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS) are used.

## Performance

- [ ] Test the performance of endpoints to ensure they respond in a timely manner.
- [ ] Optimize database queries to minimize load times.
- [ ] Confirm that the system can handle the expected load (conduct load testing if necessary).
- [ ] Check for efficient use of resources (CPU, memory).

## Error Handling

- [ ] Ensure that meaningful error messages are returned for client-side handling.
- [ ] Confirm that errors are logged appropriately for troubleshooting.
- [ ] Verify that the system handles exceptions gracefully and maintains stability.

## Code Quality

- [ ] Review the code for readability and maintainability.
- [ ] Ensure that the code adheres to the project's coding standards and guidelines.
- [ ] Remove any commented-out code or unnecessary debugging logs.
- [ ] Conduct a peer review or code review with another team member.

## Documentation

- [ ] Update API documentation to reflect new or changed endpoints.
- [ ] Document any new business logic or important changes in the code.
- [ ] Ensure database schema changes are documented.
- [ ] Add comments to the code where necessary to explain complex logic.

## Database

- [ ] Verify that all database schema changes have been applied correctly.
- [ ] Ensure that database migrations are created and tested.
- [ ] Confirm that database indexing is appropriate for new queries.
- [ ] Backup the database before deploying any changes.

## Deployment

- [ ] Test deployment scripts to ensure they work correctly.
- [ ] Confirm that environment-specific configurations are set up properly.
- [ ] Verify that the application works in a staging environment before deploying to production.
- [ ] Monitor the application post-deployment to ensure it operates smoothly.

## Final Review

- [ ] Ensure all tasks and requirements from the ticket or user story are complete.
- [ ] Communicate to the QA team that the feature is ready for testing.
- [ ] Prepare a release note if necessary, detailing the changes made.
- [ ] Ensure that all feedback from code reviews has been addressed.
