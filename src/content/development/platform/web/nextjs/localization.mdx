# Next.js Internationalization (i18n) with next-intl

In this guide you will learn how to set up internationalization (i18n) in your Next.js app.

With Next.js 13, the [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) along with support for React Server Components was introduced and announced as stable with version 13.4. Following the lead of Next.js, `next-intl` also recommends this paradigm since it increases both simplicity as well as flexibility when it comes to i18n.

## Getting Started

- **[Usage with the Pages Router](https://next-intl.dev/docs/getting-started/pages-router)**

## Best Practices for Managing Translations with `next-intl`

### 1. Split translation files by feature or page instead of having one large file per locale

#### ✅ Recommended Structure

```
messages/
├── en/
│   ├── home.json
│   ├── auth.json
│   ├── common.json
│   └── settings.json
└── vi/
    ├── home.json
    ├── auth.json
    ├── common.json
    └── settings.json
```

#### ❌ Not Recommended Structure

```
messages/
├── en.json
└── vi.json
```

#### Benefits of the Recommended Structure

| Benefit                    | Explanation                                                        |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ✅ Modular and organized   | Each file maps to a specific feature or page (e.g., Home, Auth)    |
| ✅ Easy to scale           | As you add more pages, just add more message files without clutter |
| ✅ Easier collaboration    | Developers and translators can focus only on relevant sections     |
| ✅ Cleaner version control | Smaller files reduce merge conflicts when working in teams         |
| ✅ Enables lazy loading    | You can load only the required message files per route if needed   |

### Setup Instructions

#### Step 1: Example `common.json` (shared UI labels)

Messages represent the translations that are available per language and can be provided either locally or loaded from a remote data source.

The simplest option is to add JSON files in your local project folder:

**messages/en/common.json**

```json
{
  "nav": {
    "home": "Home",
    "settings": "Settings"
  },
  "buttons": {
    "submit": "Submit",
    "cancel": "Cancel"
  }
}
```

**messages/vi/common.json**

```json
{
  "nav": {
    "home": "Trang chủ",
    "settings": "Cài đặt"
  },
  "buttons": {
    "submit": "Gửi",
    "cancel": "Hủy"
  }
}
```

#### Step 2: `next.config.ts`

Now, set up the plugin which creates an alias to provide a request-specific i18n configuration like your messages to Server Components—more on this in the following steps.

Go to official documentation for more details: [next.config.ts](https://next-intl.dev/docs/getting-started/app-router/with-i18n-routing#next-config)

#### Step 3: `src/i18n/routing.ts`

Go to official documentation for more details: [src/i18n/routing.ts](https://next-intl.dev/docs/getting-started/app-router/with-i18n-routing#i18n-routing)

#### Step 4: `src/i18n/navigation.ts`

Go to official documentation for more details: [src/i18n/navigation.ts](https://next-intl.dev/docs/getting-started/app-router/with-i18n-routing#i18n-navigation)

#### Step 5: `src/middleware.ts`

Go to official documentation for more details: [src/middleware.ts](https://next-intl.dev/docs/getting-started/app-router/with-i18n-routing#middleware)

#### Step 6: `src/i18n/request.ts`

When using features from `next-intl` inside Server Components, the internationalization setup is automatically loaded from a central configuration file located at `src/i18n/request.ts`.

By convention, this file is responsible for providing locale-aware configuration scoped to the current request. When you use a modular file structure (e.g. splitting messages into `home.json`, `auth.json`, etc.), this module can dynamically import and combine those files:

```ts
import { getRequestConfig } from "next-intl/server"
import { hasLocale } from "next-intl"
import { routing } from "./routing"

export default getRequestConfig(async ({ requestLocale }) => {
  const requested = await requestLocale
  const locale = hasLocale(routing.locales, requested)
    ? requested
    : routing.defaultLocale

  // Load split message files and merge
  const common = (await import(`../../messages/${locale}/common.json`)).default
  const home = (await import(`../../messages/${locale}/home.json`)).default
  const auth = (await import(`../../messages/${locale}/auth.json`)).default

  const messages = {
    ...common,
    ...home,
    ...auth,
  }

  return {
    locale,
    messages,
  }
})
```

#### Step 7: `src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx`

Go to official documentation for more details: [src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx](https://next-intl.dev/docs/getting-started/app-router/with-i18n-routing#layout)

#### Step 8: `src/app/[locale]/page.tsx`

Go to official documentation for more details: [src/app/[locale]/page.tsx](https://next-intl.dev/docs/getting-started/app-router/with-i18n-routing#page)

That's all it takes!

> **💡 Key Benefits:**
>
> - Supports modular translation files per page or feature
> - Keeps translations organized and scalable
> - Ensures the right messages are loaded for each request
> - Works seamlessly with Server Components

### 2. Translation Key Naming Convention

A well-structured translation system is essential for building scalable and maintainable multilingual applications. Below is a recommended convention for naming translation keys when using next-intl, especially with split JSON files per feature or page.

> **✅ Recommended Key Naming Convention**
>
> Since each file is already scoped by context, keys inside the file should use nested groupings, but do not need a redundant namespace prefix.

#### ✅ Good Example – auth.json:

```json
{
  "form": {
    "email": "Email",
    "password": "Password"
  },
  "button": {
    "login": "Login",
    "register": "Register"
  },
  "error": {
    "invalid": "Invalid email or password"
  }
}
```

**📦 In your code:**

```ts
import {useTranslations} from 'next-intl';

const t = useTranslations('auth');

<Form.Input label={t('form.email')} />
<Form.Input label={t('form.password')} />
```

#### ❌ Bad Examples

**Flat and long keys with manual namespacing:**

```json
{
  "auth_form_email": "Email",
  "auth_button_login": "Login"
}
```

**Issues:**

- ❌ Verbose and repetitive
- ❌ Difficult to manage and group logically
- ❌ Weak IDE support

**Redundant nesting with filenames:**

```json
{
  "Auth": {
    "form": {
      "email": "Email"
    }
  }
}
```

**Issues:**

- ❌ Duplicates the file context (file is already `auth.json`)
- ❌ Requires `t('Auth.form.email')` instead of `t('form.email')`
- ❌ Harder to scan visually
