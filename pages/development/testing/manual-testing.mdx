## 1. What is Manual Testing? 

**Manual Testing** it is a form of software testing in which the tester manually performs actions on the software (without using automation tools) to:

- Verify whether the software functions as expected.
- Check whether the software operates according to the requirement.

## Characteristics of Manual Testing:

| Criteria                              | Description                                                          |
|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **No automation tools used**        | Testers perform actions manually without using scripts to run tests    |
| **User-focused perspective** | Simulates the experience of a real end-user                                   |
| **Applied to functionality & UI** | Especially effective for UI testing, usability, and exploratory testing      |
| **Suitable for frequently changing software**     | Updating automated test scripts can be time-consuming |


## 2. How to do Manual Testing?

## The basic manual testing process includes:

---

### Step 1: Requirement Analysis

**Objective:** To clearly understand how the application under test works.

- Read documents such as: SRS, PRD, Use Case, User Story, etc.
- Discuss with the BA or Developer if any requirements are unclear.
- Identify key features and important functionalities that need to be tested.

---

### Step 2: Write Test Case

**Objective:** Create a clear and comprehensive test plan covering all necessary steps.

ðŸ“„ **Refer to the test case template:**  
ðŸ‘‰ [Open the Test Case template ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vRh9sIMJBIWO-IVh2ImgZ0zgEuxDI2wn/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106078261355383157012&rtpof=true&sd=true)

Writing test cases helps ensure systematic testing and prevents omissions.

### Step 3: Test Environment Setup

- Has the application been deployed to the test environment?
- Is a test account required?
- Does the database contain the necessary test data?
- Are the test devices and browsers ready?

---

### Step 4: Test Execution

- Execute each step in the test case.
- Compare the actual result with the expected result.
- Record the result (Pass/Fail).
- If an issue is found â†’ proceed to the next step.

---

### Step 5: Bug Reporting

Use tools such as: **Jira**, **Azure DevOps**, **Redmine**...



---

### Step 6: Retest and Regression Testing

- After the developer fixes a bug â†’ perform retesting to confirm the issue has been resolved.
- If the fix may impact other parts of the system â†’ perform regression testing.


---

### Step 7: Test Report

The report should include:
- Total number of test cases: how many passed / failed?
- Total bugs found and how many have been fixed.
- Any issues encountered during testing and remaining risks.
