# Test Activities And Testwares

Test Activities is a set of tasks performed throughout the software testing process, from initiation to completion. These activities are not limited to executing test cases but also encompass planning, designing, executing, and evaluating results.
The software testing process is divided into the following key phases:

## 1. Test Planning

Test planning is the first activity, where the goals, strategies, resources, schedule, and risks related to the testing process are identified.

#### Key Elements in Test Planning:

- Test Objectives and Scope: Define which features or parts of the software will be tested.

- Resources and Testing Tools: Decide on the tools, techniques, and resources required for testing.

- Schedule and Timeline: Plan the timeline for each phase of the testing process.

- Risk Identification: Assess potential risks and define mitigation strategies.

#### Testware in Test Planning:

- During this phase, testing-related documentation is identified and prepared. Specifically, the Test Plan is created as the most critical output of this phase.

- The Test Plan includes details such as the testing scope, strategy, acceptance criteria, and necessary resources like testing tools, test data, and test environments.

## 2. Test Design

In this phase, test cases, test data, and the test environment are designed. The goal is to create detailed, well-structured test cases that cover the functionality, performance, and non-functional requirements of the software.

#### Key Activities in Test Design:

- Create Test Cases: Write test scenarios that validate the software's behavior against requirements.

- Prepare Test Data: Develop or select appropriate data sets to execute the test cases.

- Define Acceptance Criteria: Ensure that the criteria for passing or failing the tests are well-defined.

#### Testware in Test Design:

Testware here includes the creation of Test Cases, Test Scripts, Test Data, and the test environment. This is when you develop the actual resources required for executing tests.

- Test Cases: Detailed testing scenarios that testers will execute.

- Test Scripts: Automated test scripts are written for running automated tests.

- Test Data: Data sets are either created or selected to be used in testing.

## 3. Test Execution

Test execution involves running the designed test cases on the system or application under test. This phase is more than just executing test cases; it involves recording results, tracking defects, and updating the status of identified issues.

#### Key Activities in Test Execution:

- Execute Test Cases: Perform the actual testing based on the predefined test cases.

- Record Results: Log the results of the executed tests, including successes and failures.

- Track and Report Defects: Report any defects found during execution and track their resolution.

#### Testware in Test Execution:

- In this phase, Test Scripts and Test Data are executed on the predefined test environment.

- Automated testing tools (if any) use Testware to run automated tests.

- Test Logs are created to track the results of each test execution, helping to identify and report defects.

## 4. Test Evaluation

After executing the tests, the results are evaluated to determine if the software meets the specified requirements and quality standards. This phase helps in analyzing the effectiveness of testing and making necessary adjustments.

#### Key Activities in Test Evaluation:

- Compare Actual Results with Expected Results: Assess whether the software behaves as expected.

- Evaluate Test Effectiveness: Analyze the test coverage and whether all requirements have been adequately tested.

- Test Reports: Generate comprehensive reports that summarize the outcomes of testing.

#### Testware in Test Evaluation:

- During evaluation, Test Logs and test reports are used to assess the completeness and effectiveness of the tests.

- A Test Summary Report is created from the test execution results, summarizing defects, test success rates, and other key metrics.

## 5. Test Closure

Test closure is the final phase where the testing process is formally concluded. This involves compiling all results, generating closure reports, and storing documentation for future reference or maintenance.

#### Key Activities in Test Closure:

- Summarize Test Results: Create a test summary report that captures the results of testing.

- Evaluate the Testing Process: Conduct a retrospective to identify lessons learned for future projects.

- Store Test Documentation: Archive all relevant test documentation (test cases, defect reports, results) for future reference.

#### Testware in Test Closure:

- After testing is complete, all related documentation (such as Test Cases, Test Logs, Test Summary Report) is archived and reported. These documents, collectively known as Testware, are organized and stored for future use or for reference when needed.

- This documentation also helps evaluate the testing process and extract lessons for future projects.

Throughout the Test Activities, Testware is not just the output of each testing phase, but also the tools, documents, and data that support the execution of the tests. Although many of testing activities may appear to follow a logical sequence, they are often implemented iteratively or in parallel. These testing activities usually need to be tailored to the system and the project.
