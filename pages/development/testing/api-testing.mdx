## 1. What is API Testing?

### Definition:
API Testing is the process of testing **Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)** directly to ensure that:

- The data exchange between systems is **correct and consistent**.
- The API functions properly according to **technical specifications**.
- The responses are accurate in **format, security, and performance**.

ðŸ’¡ *Think of API as a bridge between the frontend and the backend.*  
It has no graphical interface, so testers use tools like **Postman, Swagger, or Curl** to send requests and check responses.

## 2. How to Perform API Testing?

### Step 1: Understand the API to Test

Read the API documentation to know:

- **Endpoint, Method**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
- **Input Parameters**: Query, Path, Body, Header
- **Expected Response**: Status code, JSON/XML format, response body
- **Authentication Requirements**: Token, API key, OAuth?

---

### Step 2: Use Tools to Send Requests and Get Responses

- Most commonly used tools: **Postman**, **Swagger UI**
- Useful for sending test requests and analyzing responses

---

### Example: Test `POST /api/login`

| Field   | Value                                |
|---------|--------------------------------------|
| URL     | `https://domain.com/api/login`       |
| Method  | `POST`                                |
| Headers | `Content-Type: application/json`      |
| Body    | `{"username":"test01", "password":"abc123"}` |

**Expected Result:**

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR..."
}
```

Status Code: `200 OK`

ðŸ’¡ *Test cases can be written and managed in tools like Excel.*

---

### Step 4: Test Authentication and Authorization

Many APIs require a valid token or key to access resources. You should:

- Test with a **valid token** â†’ Should return data (success)
- Test with an **expired or invalid token** â†’ Should return 401 Unauthorized
- Test with **no token** â†’ Should return 401 Unauthorized
- Test **role-based access** â†’ e.g. only Admins can access `/api/admin`

---

### Step 5: Validate Status Codes and Responses

Check that the API returns correct **HTTP status codes** and the **response structure** is accurate.

| HTTP Code | Meaning                        |
|-----------|--------------------------------|
| 200 OK    | Request successful             |
| 201 Created | New resource created         |
| 400 Bad Request | Invalid input            |
| 401 Unauthorized | Missing or invalid auth |
| 403 Forbidden | No permission              |
| 404 Not Found | Endpoint does not exist    |
| 500 Internal Server Error | Server crash   |


---

### Step 6: Apply Common Testing Techniques

| Technique           | Description                                                  |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Positive Testing    | Valid input, expect successful result                        |
| Negative Testing    | Invalid input, missing field, wrong formats                  |
| Boundary Testing    | Test value limits (e.g. string length, number ranges)        |
| Security Testing    | Test unauthorized access, SQL injection, XSS, etc.           |
| Schema Validation   | Make sure response follows expected JSON/XML schema          |
| Performance Testing | Check speed & stability under load (using JMeter, K6, etc.)  |

---

### Step 7: Report Bugs Clearly

If the API does not behave as expected, report the issue with all necessary details:

- Title, endpoint, input
- Expected result vs. actual result
- Screenshots/logs, severity level
- Use Redmine or Excel to manage bugs
