### Urgent Cases  
In the case of an **urgent situation** (e.g., illness, accident, natural disaster), requests should be submitted as soon as possible. While we understand that emergencies can arise, timely communication helps ensure smooth team operations.  

## Leave Request Format  

All leave requests should be sent in the following format:

>Hi all, cc @Quynh Nguyen @Phuong Vo  
>
>**- Time off:** [Start Time] - [End Time], [Date]  
>**- Reason:** [Clear and specific reason]


Example:

>Hi all, cc @Quynh Nguyen @Phuong Vo  
>
>**- Time off:** 17:00 - 18:00, 27/02/2025  
>**- Reason:** I handle the paperwork at the Committee of Ngu Hanh Son district.

## Guidelines for Providing Reasons  

To foster **transparency** and **team empathy**, all leave requests should include **a clear and specific reason**.

ðŸš« **Avoid vague terms like:**
- "Personal issues"
- "Private matters"
- "Busy with something" 

âœ… **Instead, be transparent and professional:**
- **Acceptable reasons:**
  - "Doctorâ€™s appointment at [clinic/hospital name]"
  - "Attending a family wedding in [location]"
  - "Handling paperwork at [government office name]"
  - "Taking care of a sick family member"

This approach ensures that everyone understands the context without unnecessary details while fostering a culture of trust and fairness.  

By following these guidelines, we create a supportive and accountable work environment for all team members.
