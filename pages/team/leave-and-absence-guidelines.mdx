### Urgent Cases  
In the case of an **urgent situation** (e.g., illness, accident, natural disaster), requests should be submitted as soon as possible. While we understand that emergencies can arise, timely communication helps ensure smooth team operations.  

## Leave Request Approval Process  

Before requesting a day off, please familiarize yourself with (the companyâ€™s leave regulation)[/team/leave-and-absence-guidelines#request-off-regulation]. Ensure you check your available vacation and personal days before submitting a request.  

<Steps>  
### Step 1: Request Submission

There are two cases for submitting a leave request:

- **Developer/Project Member:**
  - Submits their leave request to their Scrum Master (SM), Team Leader, or Manager (depending on the project) for approval, including a specific private reason.
  - Ensures that arrangements for coverage are made before submitting the request.

- **SM/Leader/Manager:**
  - Submits their leave request to Mr. Quynh (CEO) for a approval, including the specific private reason.

### Step 2: Evaluation and Approval

- **SM/Team Leader/Manager:**
  - Assesses the project situation, teamwork, and workload before making a decision.  

#### Special Requests:
For the following cases, SM/Team Leader/Manager must escalate the request to the Board of Directors (BOD) for approval before finalizing:
- Long leave (> 2 days)
- Family emergencies
- Private matters
- Enrolling in a long-term course

### Step 3: Final Approval & Notification

- **SM/Team Leader/Manager/CEO:** Grants final approval by emails, Slack messages, SMSs.
- **Team Member on Leave Request:**
  - (Informs all relevant members)[/team/leave-and-absence-guidelines#leave-request-format] via the companyâ€™s Slack chat group, including the date, time, and optionally the reason.
  - Cc Mr. Quynh (CEO) & Ms. Phuong (Accountant) for tracking purposes.

</Steps>

## Leave Request Format  

All leave requests should be sent in the following format:

>Hi [@Your team member], cc @Quynh Nguyen @Phuong Vo  
>
>**- Time off:** [Start Time] - [End Time], [Date]  
>**- Reason:** [Clear and specific reason]


Example:

>Hi , cc @Quynh Nguyen @Phuong Vo  
>
>**- Time off:** 17:00 - 18:00, 27/02/2025  
>**- Reason:** I handle the paperwork at the Committee of Ngu Hanh Son district.

## Guidelines for Providing Reasons  

To foster **transparency** and **team empathy**, all leave requests should include **a clear and specific reason**.

ðŸš« **Avoid vague terms like:**
- "Personal issues"
- "Private matters"
- "Busy with something" 

âœ… **Instead, be transparent and professional:**
- **Acceptable reasons:**
  - "Doctorâ€™s appointment at [clinic/hospital name]"
  - "Attending a family wedding in [location]"
  - "Handling paperwork at [government office name]"
  - "Taking care of a sick family member"

This approach ensures that everyone understands the context without unnecessary details while fostering a culture of trust and fairness.  

By following these guidelines, we create a supportive and accountable work environment for all team members.
